## Abstract
Air pollution, particularly particulate matter (PM), has become a critical global public health 
concern. PM10 and PM<sub>2.5</sub> are especially significant due to their severe health impacts. Accurate assessment of PM<sub>2.5</sub> and PM<sub>10</sub> exposure with high spatial and temporal resolution is essential for evaluating health effects. 
In this study, we developed a High-Resolution Particulate Matter Estimation via Trained Stacking (HR-PMTS) model to estimate the distribution of PM with high spatial (1 km × 1 km) and temporal (hourly) resolutions. By using stacking to downscale and integrate station and grid data, significantly improved the PM prediction ability. The Stacking method notably enhances computational efficiency, reducing prediction times by an average of 20 times compared to deep learning models. Our analysis included examining population-weighted PM levels against the World Health Organization’s Air Quality Guideline levels across different age groups, revealing differing trends for PM10 and PM2.5. Population-weighted PM levels generally showed an increase, with 66% of areas for PM2.5 and 56% of areas for PM10 experiencing higher concentrations when compared to unweighted PM. Additionally, we investigated the correlation between population-weighted PM and various land cover types, finding significant correlations with Built-Up and Crops. This indicates that regions with more human and agricultural activities tend to have higher PM concentrations, suggesting a direct impact of land use on air quality. In conclusion, the findings of this study are invaluable for developing effective environmental and health policies. By enhancing the understanding of the relationship between particulate matter, population distribution, and land cover, this research offers critical insights for policymakers to devise targeted strategies.

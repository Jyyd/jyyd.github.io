# Welcome JYYD Homepage ü§ù
> üéØ **Availability (Postdoc)**  
> Expected Ph.D. completion: **June 2026**. I will be available for postdoctoral positions from **July 2026** and warmly welcome enquiries or informal chats about potential roles or collaborations: [jyyd23@mails.tsinghua.edu.cn](mailto:jyyd23@mails.tsinghua.edu.cn).


# About Me 

I'm a sixth-year Ph.D. student (*Class of 2023*) at the [School of Safety Science](https://www.ssafs.tsinghua.edu.cn/index.htm), [Tsinghua University](https://www.tsinghua.edu.cn/). My research interests include probabilistic risk analysis, applications of machine learning in safety (*AI4Safety*), and generative models for rapid reconstruction of gas dispersion.

I am very fortunate to be advised by ([**Prof. Xiaole Zhang**](https://www.ssafs.tsinghua.edu.cn/en/info/1498/1021.htm)) from the School of Safety Science at Tsinghua University. Under his guidance I explore cutting-edge approaches to enhance safety science, risk management, and real-time emergency response systems.

I welcome collaboration, discussion, and questions from faculty, peers, and students. Please feel free to reach out ‚Äî I'm happy to talk about research, potential collaborations, or student mentorship.

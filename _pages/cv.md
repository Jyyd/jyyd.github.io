  - **Supervisor:** Professor Wei Zhao.


Research Experience
======
My research includes: **AI4Safety** (the application of machine learning & deep learning to physical-world public-safety problems such as emergency management and disaster response — *not* cybersecurity), **atmospheric pollutant diffusion prediction**, **data assimilation for hazardous-chemical leakage forecasting**, and **probabilistic risk analysis**. 


* **Atmospheric transport and quantitative risk of ultra-fine particles** *(09/2023 - present)*
  - **ML Model:** Developed a stacked ensemble machine learning framework (Stem-PNC) integrating data-driven and physicochemical models to simulate ultrafine particle (UFP) number concentrations at high spatiotemporal resolution (1 km; 1 hour).
  - **Risk Analysis:** Enabled regional-scale UFP exposure assessment and health risk evaluation, providing new insights into environmental pollutant impacts.
  - Articles have been published in [**Nature Communications**](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-025-56581-8).


* **Data Assimilation-Driven Environmental Impact Assessment Technology for Hazardous Chemical Leakage** *(09/2023 - present)*
  - **Rapid Prediction Model:** Developed a deep learning-based model for real-time forecasting of emergency scenarios using meteorological data.
  - **Data Assimilation with Deep Learning:** Use a deep learning surrogate model to update and correct predictions through sensor data assimilation.
  - **Low-Cost Sensor Network & Web Platform:** Established a low-cost sensor network and a web-based system for real-time data collection, prediction, and model calibration.
  - Achieved applied outcomes with two registered *software copyrights*.

* **Food Security Supervision Model Design** *(09/2021-2023/09)*
  - Built a big-data-driven supervisory system for grain storage safety, combining statistical analysis, predictive modeling, and clustering methods.
  - Use Neo4j graph database for relationship mining, and apply natural language processing (NLP) for sentiment analysis and text summarisation.
  - Articles have been published in [*Journal of Safety Science and Resilience*](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2666449622000500?via%3Dihub).
